# How to View, Edit, Annotate and Redact Salesforce Record Attachment Files in a Lightning Web Component

## Guide
This repository serves as the code-along sample for this [guide](https://www.pdftron.com/blog/webviewer/view-edit-annotate-and-redact-salesforce-record-attachments/).

## Architecture
WebViewer integrates with Salesforce by using WebViewer's source files in Salesforce's /staticresources/ - we leverage LWC to contain WebViewer UI inside of an iframe. We can use the LWC component to communicate with other LWC components, as well as Apex to retrieve files, user information and other data from Salesforce to build a fully custom document workflow.
